**Embracing AI in Content Management **

**Introduction:**
Recently, Tom Cranstoun, a recognised figure in the CMS community, shared his valuable insights gleaned from the CMS Kick Off conference held in Florida. This event, a melting pot for CMS leaders, focused on the integration of AI in content management, a topic of growing importance in our digital age.

**Core Themes:**
The conference delved into various facets of AI in the content management arena. Key topics included the advent of generative AI, evolving content models, strategies for multi-channel content distribution, the development of AI roadmaps, and the dynamics of content teams in the AI era.

**Navigating Challenges:**
Tom highlighted several challenges associated with AI-driven content creation. These encompass issues like legal issues, regulation, repeatability, the imperative of establishing trust, navigating regulatory landscapes, and addressing cultural nuances – all crucial considerations in the ethical deployment of AI in content management.

**Unveiling Opportunities:**
The discussion also pivoted to the myriad opportunities AI presents in content consumption. Emerging trends such as AI agents, causal AI, the application of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), and AI Optimization (AIOs) were explored, indicating a transformative phase in content engagement and management.

**The HTML Conundrum:**
A significant point of discussion was the complexity of HTML in the context of AI comprehension. He illustrated this with the example of a well-known internet retailer’s product pages, where messy and unstructured HTML impedes AI's ability to discern semantic meaning and intent – a common barrier on many websites.

**Revolutionizing Through Content Modelling and Schema:**
Addressing this issue, he proposed the adoption of content modelling and schema. By implementing semantic content wrappers, content can be structured in a manner that is comprehensible to AI. He demonstrated this through a reimagined Amazon product page, employing schema.org vocabulary and item properties for clearer markup.

**Advantages of Content Modelling and Schema:**
Tom argued that content modelling and schema enhance AI performance and obviate the need for AI to develop unique language models for different brands. This approach could boost sales, engagement, and customer loyalty as AI agents become adept at interpreting site content more accurately.

**AI Agents and Web Scraping:**
Delving deeper, he discussed the potential of AI agents using web scraping to make purchases anonymously. This capability could revolutionise purchasing dynamics, enabling AI agents to procure products like tickets, vehicles, or toys at competitive prices for resale, albeit with implications for personalised marketing strategies and website traffic.

**Ethical Considerations and Relationship Building:**
Contrasting his perspective,  the industry needs to balance profit with ethical considerations and privacy concerns, advocating for a holistic approach that fosters customer relationships without compromising data integrity.
